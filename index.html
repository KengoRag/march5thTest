				What Are Wireframes?
			</h2>

			<p>
				Wireframes are drawings/sketches you make of your idea of a website. This drawing helps you visualize your website before programming. We use them because having a drawn representation of what you want makes writing your code easier.

				Git Workflow
			</h2>

			<p>
				Git workflow helps when working in groups. Each team member is assigned a branch for them to push their work to. Then, the group leader can decide which branches get merged with the master branch. Then, everyone in the group can pull the data from the master branch. This workflow allows for everyone to be on the same page by pulling from the master. This workflow is also useful because it allows a leader to decide which code to merge with the master and which ones not to.
